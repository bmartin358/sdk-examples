These SDK examples are provided by Decisions to help illustrate how you can use behaviors.

Behaviors allow you to control the product, showing only the actions and features that you want to show.

Most of the time behaviors are added to Flows and Rules created in a certain spot.  This certain "spot" is always a 
folder so you should start with the "LoanApplicationFolderBehavior"

A first "LoanApplicationRules" folder is created by the LoanSDKInitializer class on your .dll being loaded
into Decisions.
